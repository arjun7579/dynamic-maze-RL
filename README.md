# 🧩 Finding Optimized path in a Dynamic Maze using Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)

This repository contains a Python implementation of Q-learning for finding the optimal path to go from source to destination in a maze with Dynamic Obstacles.

### Structure

- **📃README.md**: This file you're reading, providing an overview of the project and how to use it.
- **🧑‍💻main/**: Contains the main script `dynamic-maze-optimum-path-qL.py` for implementing the Q-learning algorithm and the file `enviroment-parameters.md` which gives a small info about the enviroment parameters.
- **🖼screenshots/**: Contains output screenshots as `output-1.png` & `output-2.png`  as well as a file named `output-description.md` which describes the output.
